To compile and run the test program using the command line interface (CLI) in Ubuntu, you would use the `g++` compiler (part of the GNU Compiler Collection). If you don't have it installed, you can install it using the package manager `apt`. Here's how you would do it step by step:

1. **Install g++ if it's not already installed:**
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install g++
   ```

2. **Compile the program:**
   Navigate to the directory containing your `AtomicBuffer.hpp` and `AtomicBufferTest.cpp` files. Then compile the test program with:
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++11 -pthread -o AtomicBufferTest AtomicBufferTest.cpp
   ```
   Here's what the flags mean:
   - `-std=c++11`: This tells the compiler to use the C++11 standard, which is necessary for `std::atomic` and `std::thread`.
   - `-pthread`: This links the pthread library, which is necessary for using `std::thread`.
   - `-o AtomicBufferTest`: This specifies the output file name for the compiled program.

3. **Run the compiled program:**
   After compilation, you can run the program with:
   ```sh
   ./AtomicBufferTest
   ```

If everything is correct, the program should compile without errors, and when you run it, you should see output indicating that items are being produced and consumed, followed by a message that all items were processed successfully. If there are any compilation errors or runtime assertions, you'll need to address those in your code.
