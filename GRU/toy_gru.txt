Here's a C++ implementation of a toy GRU example, demonstrating its core operations and structure:

Key points:

Structure: The GRU class encapsulates weights, biases, and hidden state.
Forward pass: The forward function performs core GRU operations:
Combines input and previous hidden state.
Calculates update and reset gates using sigmoid activation.
Computes candidate activation using tanh.
Blends previous hidden state and candidate activation based on update gate.
Returns the final hidden state.
Helper functions: Not shown here, but implementation would include functions for matrix multiplication (dot), vector concatenation (concatenate), element-wise multiplication (multiply), and activation functions (sigmoid, tanh).
Random initialization: Weights and biases are initialized randomly for training.
Example usage: The main function demonstrates basic usage with a sample input.
Remember: This is a simplified example for illustration. Real-world GRU implementations often involve optimization techniques, backpropagation for training, and integration with broader neural network architectures.
